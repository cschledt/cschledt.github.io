# Arizona 2021

In the spring of 2021 we visited Arizona.

Our stops included Petrified National Forest, Winslow, Sedona, Jerome, Crown King, Peach Springs, and the Colorado River.

A piece of a petrified tree trunk in Petrified National Forest. We only had a couple hours to spare so we made a quick pass through.

The view from near the peak of Schnebly Hill road, looking back toward Sedona. Unfortunately the road was closed here and we could go no further.

I believe this was from Red Rock Loop Road, looking southeast. Lots of great scenery and hiking trails in this area.

Standing beneath an amazing Saguaro Cactus. Based on height, this one may be more than 100 years old.

Smiley Rock Trail runs through the bottom of Martin Canyon (southwest of Woodchute Mountain) between Forest Road 318A and the Potato Patch Campground on Highway 89A. Somewhere along the way, you will find Smiley Rock!

The beginning of Backway to Crown King. This is the long way into the town of Crown King in the Bradshaw Mountains, leaving out from near Lake Pleasant / Highway 74 north of Phoenix. While not a difficult trail, long wheelbase vehicles with modest lifts may get hung up now and then. It's a beautiful drive, though.

Unfortunately, we did not make it in time to eat at Crown King Saloon & Cafe. We'll have to leave earlier next time!

Our next stop was the Colorado River via Indian Route 6, north of Peach Springs, AZ. This is Haulapai Indian Reservation Land and you must buy a permit from Haulapai Game & Fish in order to visit and camp at Diamond Creek Beach. It is roughly an hour drive from Peach Springs to the Colorado River with great views along the way.

My Eureka! Timberline 2 at Diamond Creek Beach. Great little tent if you have limited space (like in my old two door) and are only camping for a night or two.

The next morning we drove back south toward Peach Springs to return to Sedona. What a sight!

Soldier's Pass Trail is in the back of a neighborhood on the north side of Sedona. It's a very short out and back that's pretty easy but has some great sights. It is highly trafficed though with hikers and other visitors, so if you attend be careful.

This sink hole is called the 'Devils Kitchen'

These are some of the 'Seven Sacred Pools'

Just some Sedona rock in the background, near Devil's Kitchen.

I did not get many pictures on Broken Arrow, but it was our last trail of the trip. This is another fantastic out and back trail located on the east side of Sedona. It is also one of the busiest, with hikers, bikers, and Pink Jeep Tours all moving throughout. If you are looking for a peaceful trail - this isn't it. But if you are looking for some great sights close to town and a lightly technical trail, you won't be dissapointed.
