# Arizona 2021

In the spring of 2021 we visited Arizona.

Our stops included Petrified National Forest, Winslow, Sedona, Jerome, Crown King, Peach Springs, and the Colorado River.

A piece of a petrified tree trunk in Petrified National Forest. We only had a couple hours to spare so we made a quick pass through.

The view from near the peak of Schnebly Hill road, looking back toward Sedona. Unfortunately the road was closed here and we could go no further.

I believe this was from Red Rock Loop Road, looking southeast. Lots of great scenery and hiking trails in this area.

Standing beneath an amazing Saguaro Cactus. Based on height, this one may be more than 100 years old.

Smiley Rock Trail runs through the bottom of Martin Canyon (southwest of Woodchute Mountain) between Forest Road 318A and the Potato Patch Campground on Highway 89A. Somewhere along the way, you will find Smiley Rock!

The beginning of Backway to Crown King. This is the long way into the town of Crown King in the Bradshaw Mountains, leaving out from near Lake Pleasant / Highway 74 north of Phoenix. While not a difficult trail, long wheelbase vehicles with modest lifts may get hung up now and then. It's a beautiful drive, though.

Unfortunately, we did not make it in time to eat at Crown King Saloon & Cafe. We'll have to leave earlier next time.
